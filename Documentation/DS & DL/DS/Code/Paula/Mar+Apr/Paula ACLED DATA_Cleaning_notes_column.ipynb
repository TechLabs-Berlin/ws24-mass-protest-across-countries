The police prohibited the registration of a gathering later on and broke up the demonstration due to continuous violations against the peacefulness requirements of the assembly law, 'anti-Israel and violence-glorifying chants' and mummery. The demonstrators had chanted 'Yallah Intifada', 'Free Palestine' and 'From the river to the sea', which are usually banned by the police at demonstrations because it questions Israel's right to exist, despite the police asking the event's leader to influence the participants to refrain from anti-Israel slogans. Since the leader did not comply, the police intervened to dissolve the demonstration, took the personal data of the demonstrators, filed 6 charges for resistance, assaulting officers and breach of peace as well as provisionally arrested several people who did not want to leave despite the dispersal of the gathering. Two police officers were injured.\n","171                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 several dozen Last Generation activists protested on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin - Mitte (Berlin) for climate reasons.

Mitte (from Alexanderplatz) to Berlin - Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg (via Rotes Rathaus and Friedrichstrasse) against inflation, energy prices and rising rents, as well as to denounce far-right ideologies and conspiracy theories. They gathered under the motto 'Redistribute' to call for social justice. Demonstrators advocated a price cap for electricity, heating costs and rents, as well as higher wages. On Wilhelmstrasse, demonstrators threw paint bags against the walls of the SPD federal headquarters. Pyrotechnics were briefly ignited, slightly injuring a police officer.\n","564                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Chinese students demonstrated in Berlin - Mitte against the Chinese government.\n","565                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            around 350 people (according to the police), including members of the Iranian community, demonstrated in Berlin - Mitte at the Brandenburg Gate to express solidarity with the protests in Iran and call on the German government to do more diplomatically.
