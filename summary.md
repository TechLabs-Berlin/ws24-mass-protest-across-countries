Find My Protest is a collaborative project that combines the expertise of UX designers, web developers, data scientists, and AI experts to create a website showcasing past and future protests in Berlin and its neighborhoods. Users can easily access and stay informed about local activism through our platform, which provides comprehensive data on past protests and upcoming events based on chosen categories of interest and districts, or other specifically searched terms.
